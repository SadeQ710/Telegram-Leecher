"""
Simplified dynamic bot settings module.

In the original mirrorâ€‘leech bot a comprehensive set of interactive
configuration options were available.  Those options required a
significant amount of code and integration with a database and have
been omitted here for brevity.  Instead this module exposes a small
collection of defaults which can be imported elsewhere in the project.
If you need to extend or change these values you may modify this
module directly or provide your own environment variables or
``.env`` file.
