Google Drive status tracking class.

This module provides a thin wrapper around the ``BaseStatus`` class
defined in ``status/__init__.py``.  It is used to represent the
state of a Google Drive download or upload.  The original
mirrorâ€‘leech project contained a much richer implementation that
reported detailed metrics via a web UI; this simplified version only
stores basic progress information and a reference to the listener
object.
