NZB download status tracking class.

This module defines a simple status class for NZB downloads handled
via SABnzbd.  The original mirrorâ€‘leech project implemented a
detailed status reader that queried the SABnzbd API for real time
information.  To minimise complexity this reimplementation inherits
from ``BaseStatus`` and leaves the update logic as a stub.
